# headless-kali-pi
This is for my project on setting up a headless-kali-pi.

My main source of inspiration, but I was having problems and needed headless.

This was built from a combination of info.

## You will need:
- A network
- Rasberry Pi
- Another linux system - I recomend a live OS if you have windows.
- Image program - you can use win32diskimager, ApplePiBaker or Etcher 
- The kali-pi image

## Download a image program

- https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/
- https://www.tweaking4all.com/software/macosx-software/macosx-apple-pi-baker/
- https://www.balena.io/etcher/

## Download kali-pi image

- https://whitedome.com.au/re4son/sticky-fingers-kali-pi-pre-installed-image/


At this point I trust you can use one of the software to flash the kali-pi image to your SD micro
